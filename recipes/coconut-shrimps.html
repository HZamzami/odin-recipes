    <h2>Description: </h2>

    <p>These crispy shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. For dipping sauce, I use orange marmalade, mustard and horseradish mixed to taste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup beer</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups flaked coconut</li>
        <li>24 shrimp</li>
        <li>3 cups oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, combine egg, 1/2 cup flour, beer and baking powder. Place 1/4 cup flour and coconut in two separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Hold shrimp by tail, and dredge in flour, shaking off excess flour. Dip in egg/beer batter; allow excess to drip off.
            Roll shrimp in coconut, and place on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep-fryer.</li>
        <li>Fry shrimp in batches: cook, turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Using tongs, remove shrimp to paper towels to drain.
             Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
